					<h3>Visit the Bo-Kaap</h3>
					<p class="activity-info">
						Situated at the foot of Signal Hill, on the fringe of the city
						centre, and formerly known as the Malay Quarter, the Bo-Kaap’s
						origins date back to the 1760s when numerous “huurhuisjes” (rental
						houses) were built and leased to slaves. These people were known as
						Cape Malays, and were brought from Malaysia, Indonesia and the rest
						of Africa to work in the Cape.

					<h3>Nature at it's best</h3>
					<p class="activity-info">
						Make your way along the coast, past Simon’s Town, to Boulders Beach.
						Here you can view the local inhabitants—African penguins in their
						thousands. By 1982 there were only two breeding pairs remaining.
						Incredible conservation efforts have grown the Boulders colony to
						over 3,000 birds in recent years. They are now classified as an
						endangered species.
